The history of Earth Day goes back to the seventies. In the year 1970, people actually realized the grave conditions of our planet and began putting effort into protecting it. 1970 was the first year when Earth Day was celebrated. Millions of people were involved. People took to the streets, asking the government to take steps to protect nature. People from all walks of life gathered and pledged to take care of mother Earth. This way, they showed respect for mother nature and brought environmental problems to people’s attention.

US Senator Gaylord Nelson was the main inspiration behind the Earth Day event. Together with environmentalists, activists, students, and general masses, he demanded concrete action in defense of the environment. Moreover, he worked hard to take the problem to the political level.

Senator Nelson succeeded in his mission, and the first Earth Day garnered massive support from both government and common people. All people, wealthy, poor, sportsmen, businessmen, farmers, athletes, etc., took part in the event and committed to protecting Earth.

In its early years, celebrating Earth Day was only popular in the US, but soon the event became global, and countries worldwide began celebrating it. Today, more than 190 countries celebrate World Earth Day each year on April 22. The celebration involves programs and events dedicated to protecting nature, cutting down pollution, and learning about environmental protection.

Earth is the only planet that supports life. It’s unique and the only place that we got. If we can’t protect it, it will endanger our own existence.

Life on Earth is dependent on several things. Land, water, soil, forests, air are all necessary for the survival of life on Earth. But rapid industrialization, unchecked consumption of natural resources, deforestation, pollution, climate changes, etc., has caused severe damage to the Earth’s ecosystem.

Mother nature has sufficient to provide for us all; however, irresponsible excavation of its resources has led to a drastic loss to its biodiversity and poisoned its land, water bodies, and atmosphere. We have to understand that without the good health of mother nature, we won’t survive too.

Here are some essential reasons showcasing the importance of Earth Day;

Earth Day serves us as a reminder that today more than ever, there is a need for sustainable living, essential to ecological harmony. It gives us the opportunity to reflect on the importance of caring for ecosystems and conserving and protecting nature and natural life.
Earth Day acts as an alarm to make us aware of Global warming. The temperature rise has led to drastic climatic changes and global catastrophes. Earth day reminds us to take immediate steps to reverse the detrimental effects of global warming.
Earth Day pushes us towards achieving a greener economy. It aims to improve human well-being without putting an extra burden on the environment. Sustainability is at the core of the Earth Day celebration, and with sustainability, we could bring the economic changes that lead to a happier society.
Knowledge is the precursor of changes; we couldn’t bring the changes needed without knowing. In this regard, Earth Day has extreme importance because it allows us to learn about the environment, its state, and the steps needed to reverse the detrimental impacts. Earth Day imparts environmental education and allows citizens to learn beneficial habits to contribute to protecting nature.
Earth day acts as a pointer towards ecological issues. It also acts as a channel to incorporate positive changes in daily lives and negates the negative impacts on the environment. It leads to attaining newer habits that are in sync with nature, like reducing plastic use, using renewable sources of energy.
Therefore, we need a day when everyone slows down and diverts their attention to the impending dangers on our planet. Earth day inspires people to commit to environmental protection. It encourages them to take action, however small, and be a part of the global movement dedicated to saving the planet we call our home.

Earth day celebration draws attention to the global issues of pollution, global warming, overpopulation, etc. It reminds us of the importance of nature and encourages us to protect the gifts that nature provides us to sustain our existence.

What Can We Do for The Planet?
Earth day begins with each individual. When facing the question of what action, we should take to protect our planet, the answer is straightforward: promote and participate in fostering respectful behavior towards the environment. It can be as simple as switching off a light bulb when not needed; it could be turning off the tap when brushing the teeth to prevent water wastage.

There is simply nothing heavy work required. Respect nature, cut down on plastic usage, and save energy. Simple habits of limiting wastage and taking care of the surroundings, whether your home, neighborhood, garden, forest, or the sea where you go on vacation, would go a long way in protecting our planet.

The gestures to do or take small steps and the habits to change are effortless. The collective efforts of a billion individuals, even smaller ones, will resonate on a global scale and make the Earth Day celebration worthwhile. And once the change has been implemented and the habits formed, our lifestyle will be an example and an inspiration for the coming generations to be responsible towards nature and the environment.

Environmental protection is an extremely critical issue that impacts us all. It’s essential to treat nature with respect and take proper steps towards its protection.

Earth Day reminds us of our responsibility towards nature and our planet as a whole. It’s the day that encourages us to think about the grave environmental challenges we face and how we should resolve them.

If we want cleaner air to breathe, safe water to drink, and land capable of growing crops, we need to take steps to save these resources. Earth day celebration has made people learn that our planet is truly in danger, and if we don’t take concrete steps, soon there won’t be any place for us to live.
